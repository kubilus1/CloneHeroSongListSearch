# CloneHeroSongListSearch
Simple web page to search exported Clone Hero song lists

## Usage

This can be used in a couple ways.

* Just go to (https://kubilus1.github.io/CloneHeroSongListSearch/)
* Open the index.html file directly in webbrowser
* Run a local webserver such as `python -m simple.http` and point browser to `http://localhost:8000`

If you run with a local webserver, this will look for `songs.json` in the
same directory.  If this is not found or if you run the file directly in the
webbrowser you will be given a prompt to locate your `songs.json` file.

The `songs.json` file should be exported from Clone Hero via normal means.
